# Development

```
npm run watch & serve
```

The serve is necessary if using three.js to load model files.

Don't forget to kill the tsc watcher thread when you're done.

```
ps
kill <thread id>
```

# Concept

Turn the cursor into a hamburger (or something). The face will look at it.

Allow user to convert cursor to something bad. The face will look away from it.
