	<h2>Pinophyta Poster</h2>
	<p>I'm a fan of information, especially when presented on a poster. One may imagine my dismay when I couldn't find a single poster of a taxonomic branch of any part of 'life'. I made it my goal to create one. I found that the Division Pinophyta in Plantae contained a reasonable (about 630) amount of plant species. And so my poster was born. Please enjoy. If you'd like a print, please contact me via email and we could set something up.</p>

	<h2>Minecraft Adding Machine</h2>
	<p>If you like logic gates and arithmetic, then this is the fun thing for you. A 5-bit adding machine in Minecraft allows you to add one number to another by flipping levers in two areas. The result is displayed as a binary number represented by lit (or not) lamps. This result is acheived by 5 chained "adders", which consist of AND, OR, and XOR gates. World download is available here: <a href="www.straversi.github.io">Link</a></p>

	<h2>Morse Code Practicer</h2>
	<p>One thing you may not have known about me is that I am fluent in international morse code. Whether that will ever be applicable is both yours and my best guess. It is fun to tap out secret messages to other people who know the code though, even if the number of people in that category is very small. After finishing learning, I threw together a javascript morse code site, in which YOU TOO can teach yourself morse code, or just practice. Enjoy.</p>

	<h2>Some Recommendations About Coffee</h2>
	<p>One doesn't have to pay top dollar for good coffee. One is easily able to buy good beans, grind them, and brew them for reasonable prices. Over time I have compiled some of my favorite beans and brewing methods, which I have collected here for you. Open Source Coffee by Steven is available here: <a href="www.straversi.github.io">link</a>. Please feel free to share your thoughts if you feel the need to.</p>
	<h2>Best Food</h2>
	<p>Please visit these locations, their food is delicious and often affordable. Some of my favorite places around Central California.</p>

	<h2>Classroom Activity: The Physics of Horns</h2>
	<p>During my tenure as an intern at the Exploratorium, I had the pleasure of working with one <a href="straversi.github.io">Modesto Tamez</a>, a genius of Teaching. Together before the 2014 3 week Institute at the Exploratorium, we developed a classroom activity for exploring the physics behind horns and their shapes. Provided below are the lesson plans and templates for the materials. Please use them! Please also credit the Exploratorium in any reproduction of the lesson plans or templates.</p>

	<h2>Inspirational reddit Book</h2>
	<p>One thing I've been slowly working on is a compilation of inspirational tidbits posted on reddit by users. I am compiling them with illustrations and the quotes, credited to the /u/sers' account.</p>
