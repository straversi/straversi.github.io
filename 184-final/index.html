  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    This project presents a firework simulator using Unity and Oculus DK2. The simulation is accomplished by creating C# scripts and running them on Unity. The scripts use Unity Engine GameObjects and our own custom physics integration to simulate the firework launch, explosion, and particles fading. The launch was accomplished using Velocity Verlet Integration. The explosion was accomplished by uniformly sampling a unit sphere surface and launching smaller particles in the sampled direction. The particle fading was generated by using different types of light trails and making the particle disappear based on velocity and position. One of the most important and technically complex components of our project was creating the light trails that get generated behind each particle after the explosion. Due to hardware limitations, we had to come up with different ways to represent particle trails. We managed to create a realistic firework simulation by integration all of the parts mentioned above.
  </p>

  <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
  <p>
    In the following sections, we'll address technical problems we faced and solved throughout the project.
  </p>

  <h3>Physics</h3>
  <p>
    We did not use Unity's rigid body physics system for our simulation, because we wanted to implement the physics ourselves. We wrote a Verlet Integration behavior for all particles to follow. Regular Verlet did not work for long though, because we needed the ability to start a particle with velocity (as with a firework being launched, or particles exploding from a firework charge). With regular Verlet, there exists an issue called the "first timestep problem": When trying to interpolate a t=-1 position for the particle as to give it an implicit initial velocity, one needs a timestep. But since the simulation hasn't started yet, we do not know what the framerate will be. As a result, our fireworks were being launched at inconsitent velocities. To fix the problem, we switched the Velocity Verlet Integration, which stores the velocity directly. This proved to better from another perspective as well: we were able to access the velocity component of each particle for other uses, such as determining trail orientation, or fizzling probabilities.
    <br>
    Gravity was the main force acting on particles, since we launched them by setting initial velocities directly. However, we also needed a way to make the fireworks particles slow down in a drastic manner after the firework explodes. We realized that the behavior of these smaller lit particles looked like an object slowing down in a viscous material. So, we used a viscous drag force on the smaller firework particles once they exploded. This suitably matched air resistance behevior in real life.
  </p>

  <h3>Particle trails</h3>

  </div>
  <p>
    The first type of trail we created was what we called a sphere trail. It is made of many smaller particles. Each particle is represented by a Unity Game Object. The direction of the trailing particles is slightly perturbed to simulate a realistic movement. These particles fade away depending on the time they have been alive. This particular trail proved to be too expensive to render. Even though Unity doesn't render objects that lie behind other objects, this rarely happens. Since the particles are very small they all have to be rendered and it becomes very expensive, therefore we came up with better ways to represent trails.
  </p>

  <h3>Light trails</h3>

  </div>
  <p>
    Another common firework trail is a light trail, which leaves a bright streak along the path of the particle. We chose a triangle to model the fading trail of light. The long slope of a tall triangle provides the appropriate trail shape, and barycentric color interpolation gave us the fading colors we wanted. First, we thought we'd need to use a cone object to model the trail, as to be viewable from any angle. We switched to using a triangle mesh when we realized we could constantly be rotating a 2D triangle to always face the camera.
  </p>

  <h3>Faster particle trails</h3>

  <p>
    The particle trail of sphere (discussed earlier) began to pose problems when we increased the number of sphere objects in the trail. The problem is further exacerbated when the number of particles in the exploded firework is increased. We devised a new way of depicting the first particle trail type, using a mesh instead of sphere objects.
    <br>
    One can imagine a mesh existing entirely on one plane. In the mesh, small triangles can be created to emulate the behavior of the sphere trail. The mesh can be rotated to face the camera, similarly to the light trail mesh. This way, only one game object needs to be managed by the renderer. The flipside is that as the programmer, managing meshes is much more difficult than managing a list of sphere objects.
    <br>
    We tested the performance differences between the sphere particle trail and the new mesh "particle" trail. The results were positive: the mesh trails was able to handle three times as many triangles than the sphere trail was able to hold spheres. We came to this conclusion by altering the number of triangles/spheres in the trails until they produced the same framerate with the Oculus.
  </p>

  <h3>Firework File and Parameters</h3>
  <p>
    We created a file type that represents a firework. The file includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Firework position</li>
    <li>Launch velocity</li>
    <li>Charge size</li>
    <li>Firework color</li>
    <li>Number of particles created at explosion</li>
    <li>Particle speed</li>
    <li>Gravity (boolean)</li>
    <li>Triangle trail</li>
    <li>Sphere trail</li>
    <li>Particle color</li>
    <li>is firework complex?</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
    This file type allowed us to easily create fireworks. The parameters are all read into a <code> struct FireworkParams </code> which is used to create the firework. Some of the parameters get passed down to a <code>struct ParticleParams</code> during the explosion part of the simulation.
  </p>
