      Teaching

  <p class="detail">These days I teach introductory computer science at UC Berkeley. I started out teaching high school kids and other teachers.</p>
  <p class="quote">"Great TA, really helpful and approachable."<span> - UC student</span></p>
  <h2>High School</h2>
  <p>The first time I got to really lead a class was in high school. I would substitute for the IB Standard Level Math class, sometimes several days in a row. It was a unique first experience in that all I was given was a topic to make sure got covered. Lots of whiteboard use and example problems with heavy class interaction is the direction I chose to go. The class, which consisted mostly of my friends (another unique aspect), responded very well to my lessons. Some told me that they'd enjoy me as the normal teacher.
  </p>
  <h2>Exploratorium</h2>
  <p>I spent three summers with the Exploratorium Teacher Institute (TI), which teaches teachers. In this situation the amazing TI staff spends several weeks with a group of middle and high school science teachers, demonstrating great ways to teach topics of all sorts. I had the pleasure of working for them officially over the summer of 2014 through CalTeach.</p>
  <p>Toward the end of the program, Modesto Tamez, a TI staff member and friend, had me teach a session on loudspeakers. I worked to develop cheap manila folder microphones, and taught the group of teachers how to make and use them in a science classroom to demonstrate properties of sound. Teaching teachers was special. I was teaching a lesson plan. The only person more meta than me was Modesto as he in turn taught me.</p>
  <h2>UC Berkeley</h2>
  <p>I was actually at the Exploratorium when I received an offer for a TA position with CS10. After lab assisting for a semester, I'd been chosen to be brought up. Since then, I've taught 3 semesters worth of labs, discussions, and review sessions.</p>
  <h2>And Beyond</h2>
  <p>Right now I'm heading toward my 4th semester as a CS10 TA. I look forward to bringing my experience to the next education job that I </p>

  <p class="quote">"Steven is a really phenomenal TA, and I can come to him with even the most outrageous and confusing problem and he always seems to know exactly what I'm talking about. Also I really admire the fact that he just picked up teaching outside during the midterm review and didn't let the fire alarm interrupt our review session!"<span> - UC student</span></p>
