<h3>Rlist to List</h3>
<p><span class="alert">Note:</span> the concept of the rlist is not specifically taught in CS10. However, only knowledge of lists and recursion is needed to understand rlists (HOFs will help with some of the next problems too).</p>
<p>Rlist stands for "Recursive list". In Snap!, an rlist is made up 2 item lists. Index one of these mini lists contains an item, perhaps a number or a word. Index two contains an rlist (see the recursion?).</p>
<p>An empty rlist is represented by a length 0 list. Therefore the last mini list can simply be a length 1 list (the item goes in the first slot, and there is no other rlist for the second slot). This will come in handy for writing base cases in a bit.</p>
<p>For the first problem, let's write a function that takes in an rlist and returns a regular list version. For example:</p>
