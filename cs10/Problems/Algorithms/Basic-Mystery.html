<p class="Answer">The algorithm reports the reverse of a given list.<br>Let's break it down:<br>
	1. Two variables, <span class="cem">a</span> and <span class="cem">index</span>, are created. <span class="cem">a</span> is an empty list, and <span class="cem">index</span> is a number equal to the length of the input list.<br>
	2. For the length of the list, the item at index <span class="cem">index</span> of the input list is added to <span class="cem">a</span>. Then, the variable <span class="cem">index</span> is decremented by one. This accomplishes adding items of the input list into <span class="cem">a</span> backwards!<br>
	3. The list a is reported, and it is equal in value to the input list. It is not, however, the same list! This means that changes to one list do not affect the other.
