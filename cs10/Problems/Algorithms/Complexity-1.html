	<li>What is the alogrithmic complexity in terms of N, where N is the value of the variable <span class="cem">i</span>?</li>
	<li>As an bonus test of knowledge, rank the algorithmic complexities from best to worst: In no particular order: O(n), O(n^2), O(log n), O(1), O(2^n), O(n log n).

<p class="Answer">The complexity of the algorithm is O(log N). Think of it this way: You have to DOUBLE the value of i to get the script to say just ONE more item/take ONE more step (Notice how i is cut in half with each step). This is logarithmic behavior.<br>Fastest --> O(1) -> O(log n) -> O(n) -> O(n log n) -> O(n^2) -> O(2^n) --> Slowest</p>
