<h3>Mystery Utility</h3>
<p>Another case to solve: pictured below is a list utility. It appears to be recursive. <span class="cem">input</span> is a list.</p>

	<li>Identify the base case. What is happening?</li>
	<li>Identify the recursive case. What is going on?</li>
	<li>Finally, what is the function doing?</li>

<p class="Answer">1. The base case is: If the length of the list is 0, return 0.<br>2. The recursive case is the "else" case. It returns the result of adding 1 to the result of this function with all items but the first of the list.<br>3. All together, this function returns the length of the input list!</p>
