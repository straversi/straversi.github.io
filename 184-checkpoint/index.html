    <h1>Firework Checkpoint</h1>
    <h2>by Steven Traversi and Carlos Flores</h2>
    <p>CS184 Final Project Proposal</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="content">
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
      We started by writing a script that controls the movement of a sphere. Initially we used built-in Unity functions
      to simulate forces and move objects. We then realized that we could implement what we've learned in the class to generate
      a realistic trajectory simulation. We implemented Verlet integration to simulate the "firework" launching up into the air
      and slowing down by gravity.
  </p>

  <p>
      We used the position of the sphere to decide when to trigger the explosion. When we detected that it's velocity went
      below a certain threshold we triggered the explosion. The explosion consists of many spheres flying in different directions. We use
      the same integration we used to launch the firework to simulate the trajectory of each particle flowing from the explosion. We
      are currently using the built-in random function to sample a unit sphere and decide the direction of the particles, but we plan
      to implement our own method of unbiased sampling from a sphere.
  </p>

  <h2>Preliminary results</h2>
  <p>
    Our firework is currently represented by a large sphere that is launched upward and explodes into several small spheres. The framerate is very good (>40) on both the laptop and in VR.
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot of the time we spent during the first week was toward getting the Oculus Rift DK2 to work properly on our macbooks (Oculus has suspended updates to Mac OS unfortunately). We ended up succeeding, and turned to learning Unity. Much of the second week was spent learning some of the ins and outs of Unity.
  </p>
  <p>We learned that Unity has a build in physics simulator, but we implemented our own that is specific to the needs of our fireworks simulator. First, we used Verlet integration for numerical approximation, but we encountered a delta-t bug: Our particles never launched exactly the same way, but after launch, they behaved appropriately. We ended up figuring out that Verlet integration did not work with our approach to giving particles an initial velocity. We were giving an offset between the particles <em>x_t0</em> and <em>x_t-1</em> of <em>a_0 / delta_t</em>. This does not work though, because the particles initial velocity relies directly on the amount of time the simulation needs to load.</p>
  <p>To fix this bug, we switched our Verlet implementation to Velocity Verlet, which makes an adjustment to normal Verlet in that it uses a set velocity value instead of relying on subtracting the particles current and last positions. This allowed us to directly set the inital velocity instead of relying on delta-t.</p>

  <h2>Progress vs. plan</h2>
  <p>
    After two weeks, we planned to have the following tasks accomplished:
    <ol>
      <li>Get objects to appear and move in Unity using controller scripts.</li>
      <li>Finish the physics simulator and test it on small particles. Try dropping objects, launching objects, exploding objects.</li>
    </ol>
    We successfully accomplished these two tasks during the first two-week period.
  </p>

  <h2>Updated work plan</h2>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>We need to add lighting to our plan somewhere. We are expecting to need to handle lighting characteristics when we are working on particle trails.</li>
      <li>We need to create a good object collection scheme for storing all the pieces of each firework. This will involve learning a bit more about C# to make sure that we do things efficiently.</li>
      <li>Firework object storage will involve cleanup. We are thinking of starting with a basic scheme of destroying objects from the scene if their y-value is below 0. As we continue with particle decomposition, however, we are expecting to be able to be more efficient.</li>
      <li>We want to add this specific to our week 4 goal: add sound to the simulation. We now believe that realistic sounds, played at a time offset proportional to the distance between the explosion and camera, will contribute greatly to the sense of immersion in the simulation.</li>
    </ol>
