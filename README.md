Now with **ðŸ’¯%** more âœ…ðŸ”’HTTPSðŸ”’âœ…

My website. Directory structure:

```
/--
  |- blog/
  |- random files
  |- the rest is also random files
 ...
```

In the blog is a jekyll site. However, it's in compiled and compressed form. I can't let github build for me because they forbid plugins, which I use.

Yes I'm using git as a deploy tool. It's a personal blog.
